# Endpoint Updates Summary

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Purpose**: Schema alignment and missing endpoint implementation based on updated TypeScript types

---

## Phase 1: Schema Alignment Fixes ✅

### 1. Fixed `player_badges` Schema Alignment

**Issue**: Router was using `player_id` (UUID) and `badge_id` (UUID), but actual schema uses `player_wallet` (string) and `match_id` (bigint).

**Files Updated**:
- `app/routers/admin.py` - Updated badge award endpoints
- `app/schemas/badge.py` - Already correct ✅

**Changes**:
- Updated `BadgeAwardRequest` model to use correct schema fields
- Updated `PlayerBadgeResponse` model to match schema
- Removed legacy badge management endpoints (create/delete badges table)
- Fixed badge award logic to work with `player_wallet` and `match_id`

---

- Existing endpoints remain unchanged
- Enhanced endpoints use same routes with additional functionality
